# 🔫 Shooting tool

The snowman shoots at a target with a scattering effect.

His configuration is written on the floor.

The snowman has a very simple appearance—just two balls and a gun, nothing more.

Smoke comes out of the cannon.

There are numbers on the floor next to the inscriptions.

The light sources look high-quality.

There is a context with six incremental values ​​that can be edited.

There are 6 * 2 hotkeys for increasing and decreasing parameter values.

### Video

I have just created a little tool to configure spread shooting for a game.

To achieve this, I aligned the character directly toward the target, while the barrel is aimed at a small orange ball.

This ball reacts to physical impulses, with damping and a center force.

The same technique applies to the cam.
